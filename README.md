## Ideas

Let's describe my wishes for memoireDB in a few simple keywords:

- Lightweight
- Easy to use
- Distributed
- Persisted
- Customizable
- Queries
  - List keys matching pattern
  - Hashmap values
  - Get
  - Put/Set & hashmap put / hashmap set
  - Put with retention duration
  - Delete
  - Rename

The goals of this project are subject to changes, but these are my goals for now.
